				<h3 class="section2-subtitle">Strength &amp; Conditioning</h3>
				<p class="section2-paragraph">The basketball off-season is a time to lay the foundation for in-season success. Basketball players need to be big enough absorb contact, strong, explosive, able to change directions on a dime, and capable of withstanding the effects of fatigue. And they need to do all of those things while reading the defense, handling the ball and reacting to opponents.</p>

				<h3 class="section2-subtitle">Shooting</h3>
				<p class="section2-paragraph">If you're a good basketball shooter, the coach will find a spot for you on the floor, especially at the high school level. Thus, it becomes extremely important to learn the correct basketball shooting technique, and to practice various shooting drills over and over and over again. Larry Bird didn't become one of the greatest shooters of all-time just because he had a pretty shot. He practiced relentlessly too.</p>

				<h3 class="section2-subtitle">Ball Handling</h3>
				<p class="section2-paragraph">Being able to handle the basketball is a big part of the game of basketball, and even if you are center you still need to work on your hands and develop your handles some. That is why it is important to work on your handles on a regular basis. Even if it is only for 20 minutes a day. We have hundreds of dribbling drills that you can choose from, and all of the stationary drills can be done pretty much anywhere where there is a flat surface.</p>

					"My son, Gavin, who is 14 and an eighth grader, thinks Back-2 Basics Basketball is a great clinic. He has learned many things, such as the three pivots and the three counters to the pivots, and says he has gotten a lot better with every part of his game including the mental aspect of it. He comes home every day saying that he had a great time doing all of the drills and is excited to go back."
